    <p>I completed my undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University, where I majored in Computer Science and minored 
        in Chinese. During the course of my college career, I interned at Qualcomm, Amazon Web Services and Roche 
        Sequencing Solutions as a software engineer.</p>

        world, and play tennis and badminton.</p>
